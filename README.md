# HellDivers-2-MacroPad

This is still a work in progress and there are still some bugs that need to be addressed. 

#### **Known bugs**
* plugging the macro pad triggers all the key sequences
* Weird behavior when stratagems are during cooldown

#### **Wishlist**
* some sort of visual/audio alert to notify you a certain stratagem is avaliable
* GUI to easily modify macros (drag and drop type of thingy)
